# Image-Classification
Detecting Nuclei in Microscopy Images
This project was part of a coursework which we took in IIT Kharagpur, India in the data science lab. This project aims to classify
nuclei by detecting boundary boxes for nuclei by using state of the art Mask RCNN. We used U-NET, RESNET-50 and RESNET-101 as
backbone architecture for the model

We Ranked 108 world wide out of 5000+ teams in this competition at Kaggle

#Code will be added soon
